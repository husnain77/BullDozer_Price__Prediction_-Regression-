ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a regression problem.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from the fast.ai machine learning course.

What we'll end up with
Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.

To work through these topics, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.

We'll work through each step and by the end of the notebook, we'll have a trained machine learning model which predicts the sale price of a bulldozer given different characteristics about it.

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

1. Problem defition
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

2. Data
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

There are 3 main datasets:

Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.
3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation

Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.

4. Features
Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. You can view this data dictionary on Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharin
